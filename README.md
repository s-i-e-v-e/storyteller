# storyteller

* Keep using your existing text editors.
* Configure your LLM backend
* Run storyteller in your project directory and point it to your current chapter.
* It will use the specified context to query the LLM and append the response in the same chapter file. All you have to do is reload. Rinse and repeat till you are satisfied with the response.
* It is a text-based workflow. So make liberal use of git commits.
